nextjs-starter
===

A batteries-included, highly opinionated Next.js starter with MUI v6, Typescript, Testing Library/Jest, Storybook, Eslint, Prettier, and Husky git hooks all wired up and ready to go.

## Package Management
This repo uses Yarn2 (berry) and has yarn bundled in the `.yarn/releases` folder.

## Getting Started

Storybook and Jest expect to find stories and components in a `src/components/` folder, but this can be configured in
`jest.config.js` and `.storybook/main.js`
